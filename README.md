# Fashion-MNIST CNN Classifier with Optuna Hyperparameter Tuning

This project demonstrates how to build a convolutional neural network (CNN) for classifying images from the Fashion-MNIST dataset using PyTorch, with hyperparameter optimization via Optuna. The notebook includes data preprocessing, augmentation, training, evaluation, and automated tuning of model hyperparameters.


## ðŸ“ˆ Training & Results

The model is trained using the best hyperparameters found by Optuna. Training progress is logged per epoch with loss, training accuracy, and test accuracy.

Final Results:
Epoch	Loss	Train Accuracy	Test Accuracy
28	0.2829	0.8969	0.9042
29	0.2846	0.9110	0.9158
30	0.2805	0.9117	0.9134

## ðŸ›  Features

Custom PyTorch Dataset for handling Fashion-MNIST images.

Data Augmentation: Random rotation, horizontal flip, and affine transformations.

Flexible CNN Architecture: Configurable number of convolutional and fully connected layers, filter sizes, kernel sizes, and dropout rates.

Hyperparameter Optimization: Uses Optuna to search for the best combination of:

Learning rate

Optimizer type (SGD, Adam, RMSprop)

Batch size

Number of layers

Dropout rate

Weight decay

Training & Evaluation:

Tracks training loss, training accuracy, and test accuracy.

Checks for overfitting by comparing train and test accuracy per epoch.

Device Agnostic: Automatically detects and uses GPU (CUDA or Apple MPS) if available, else CPU.
